    authors: ["Zihan Yang", "Yi Chen", "Kaiqi Chen", "Xingjian Qian", "Shaojun Xu", "Yun Pan", "Chong Zeng", "Jianhai Chen", "Yin Zhang", "Zeke Wang"]
    date: "2023-11-17"
    publication: "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems"
    abstract: "In SC'21, Alexandros Nikolaos Ziogas et al. proposed a Data-Centric Python workflow in their DaCe paper. DaCe provides high productivity, performance, and portability with language extensions and automatic optimizations. We reproduce the performance evaluation results from the paper on both CPU and GPU on the Azure CycleCloud cluster. We also reproduce the scaling results with up to 32 nodes and 64 processes. Our results show that the proposed workflow in that paper has outstanding performance and scalability in the provided cluster, in accordance with the SC paper."

    abstract: "Lattice quantum chromodynamics (lattice QCD) is a theory based on quantum chromodynamics, which is widely used in strong interaction related calculations. As a research method that can give accurate and reliable theoretical results, with the improvement of computer ability, Lattice QCD is playing an increasingly important role in recent years. Distillation method is an important numerical method to calculate hadron correlation function in lattice QCD, and can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of calculated physical quantities..."

    publication: "Computer Systems & Applications"
    abstract: "Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a non-perturbative method for solving QCD based on the first principles. By simulating the interaction between gluon field and fermion field on super-cubic lattice, the calculated results are considered to be a reliable description of the phenomenon of strong interaction. Lattice calculation is of great significance to the study of QCD theory. However, the lattice QCD computing has a very large degree of freedom, which makes it difficult to improve the computational efficiency. Usually, the domain decomposition method is used to realize the scalability of parallel computing, but how to improve the efficiency of data parallel computing is still the core problem..."
